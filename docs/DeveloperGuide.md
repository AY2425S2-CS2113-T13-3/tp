## Design
### Architecture

![](images/Architecture-LeBook.png)

#### Main Components of the architecture:
- `Ui`: The Ui of the system.
- `Parser`: Process User Input.
- `Command`: Executes instructions based on commandType.
- `MemberManager`: Library members.
- `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
Data includes book details and borrower.
- `Library`: Manages global catalogue and shelves, as well as a `UndoManager`
for undoing of a command.

### Parser component
**API:** [`Parser.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/parser/Parser.java)

Shown below is a simplified class diagram of the `Parser` component:
![ParserClass](images/ParserClass.png)

The parser component is responsible for interpreting user input and calling the appropriate command object.
It takes a string input from the user, determines the corresponding command type, and returns an instance of a subclass of Command.

How the parser component works:
1. Extracts the command keyword from the user input.
2. Matches the keyword to the relevant commands.
3. Parses and extracts the remaining arguments (if any).
4. Returns a corresponding Command object for execution.

### Command component

**Overview**
- All commands extend the Command class, which is abstract and defines the execute() method.
- The execute() method in each command class contains the logic to perform a specific action.
- Each command interacts with Library (to manage catalogue and shelves), Ui (to print messages), and Storage (to save data to a file).

### Storage component
**API:** [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/storage/Storage.java)
1. **Overview**
   - The `Storage` class in LeBook is responsible for saving the data after the user exits `LeBook`. To load the data when the user launches `LeBook`, it reads data from a file and loads it into a list. When exiting the program, it writes the Books back into the file in a specific format.
2. **Design**
   - Each `Book` is stored in structured text using a `|` delimiter.
   - Each time the user exits the program, the file is overwritten, ensuring that the content is up to date.
   - If the file to save the data does not exist, an empty list is returned. Exceptions are caught and logged.
![StorageClass](images/StorageClass.png)

### Library component
**API:** [`Library.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/library/Library.java)

1. **Overview**

   -  The `Library` class in LeBook handles the job of managing all book-related operations. It contains
   a `BookManager` called catalogueManager, a `ShelvesManager` to manage the books on shelves, as well as a
   `UndoManager` to facilitate undoing of past user interactions.
   - Whenever a book-operation comes e.g `add`, both the global catalogue of books and the shelves will be modified.
     (In this case, the book is added to the global catalogue and the relevant shelf based on its `Genre`).

2. **Design**

   -  `catalogueManager`: manages the global catalogue (e.g adding / deleting).
   -  `ShelvesManager`: manages shelves of different genres. The same book in the global catalogue is also stored in their respective
   shelves.
   -  `UndoManager`: undo certain user commands like `delete` and `add` when prompted.

**Class Diagram (Library):**
![](images/Library.png)

### BookManager 
The `BookManager` class is responsible for managing the library's global catalogue of books. Within the `Library` class, it is referenced as `catalogueManager`.

It handles core operations such as:
1. Adding a book to the catalogue
2. Deleting a book from the catalogue
3. Listing all books in the catalogue
4. Borrowing and returning books
5. Providing data for statistics and search functionalities.

**Class Diagram (BookManager):**
![](images/BookManager.png)

**Design:**

*   **Singleton Pattern:** `BookManager` is implemented using the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance manages the shared book catalogue throughout the application's lifecycle. 
Access is controlled via the static `BookManager.getBookManagerInstance(List<Book> books)` method, which initializes the instance with the loaded book data on the first call.

*   **Genre Validation:** `BookManager` enforces genre constraints internally using the `isValidGenre(String genre)` method, which checks against a predefined `static final List<String> VALID_GENRES`. 
This validation is applied during the `addNewBookToCatalogue` process.

*    **Error Handling:** `BookManager` employs a mixed strategy for error communication:
     *   **Exceptions:** For critical lookup failures where an operation cannot proceed (e.g., finding a book by index/ID/title+author fails), it throws specific exceptions like `BookNotFoundException`.

### Ui component
**API:** [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/ui/Ui.java)

1. **Overview**

   - The `Ui`class in LeBook is responsible for all user interaction in the Command Line Interface (CLI).
   - `Ui` handles:
      - Displaying welcome, help and exit messages.
      - Reading user input and returning the raw command string.
      - Printing success and error messages in a standardized and formated way.
      - Displaying book lists in formatted layout.
   - `Ui` class is designed as a Singleton to ensure only one instance manages all user interaction throughout application's cycle.

2. **Design**

   - Singleton pattern: `Ui` provides static instance via `Ui.getUiInstance()` and uses private constructor to prevent multiple instances.
   - `readCommand()` -> Reads user input from terminal.
   - `printWelcomeMessage()`, `printHelp()`, `printExitMessage()` -> Prints standardized success messages.
   - `printSuccess(String message)` -> Prints standardized success message.
   - `printError(String message)` -> Prints standardized error messages.
   - `printWithSeparator(String message)` -> Prints message surrounded by separators.
   - `showBookList(List<Book> books)` -> Displays formated list of books with their details.

## Implementation

### Add Book Feature
The add book feature allows librarians to add a book to the catalogue. When the librarian wishes to add a book, the book
is added to the global catalogue in `BookManager`, and also concurrently added to the shelf in `ShelvesManager`. 

The feature is facilitated by the following components:
- `AddCommand`: A command object that encapsulates the logic for adding the book to the catalogue and shelf.
- `Library`: Responsible for managing the `BookManager` as well as the `ShelvesManager`.
- `ShelvesManager`: Responsible for sorting the books into the correct genre.
- `Shelves`: Responsible for checking the appropriate `shelf` to add the book to.

**Key Methods**
- `getSuitableIndex()` in `Shelf`:
   - Iterates through all the slots in the shelf.
   - Check for a suitable spot on the shelf.
   The spot is suitable if:
     1. A book that was in that spot and previously deleted.
     2. The spot was never occupied.

**Execution Flow**
1. The librarian enters a string input `add <Book Details>`.
2. The Parser class parses the input and creates a `AddCommand`.
3. The `execute` method in `AddCommand` class calls `Library`'s `addNewBookToCatalogue(<Book Details>)` and `addNewBookToShelf(<Book Details>)` method.
4. The `ShelfManager` iterates through its shelf indexes, checks for open slots.
5. The result is passed to the Ui, which displays it to the user.

**Sequence Diagram**

![AddBookSequence](images/AddBookSequence.png)
_Note: The `Book Details` consists of the Title, Author Name, as well as the genre._


### Delete Book Feature
The delete book feature allows librarians to delete irrelevant books
from the library using their bookID, their unique title and author or
their bookIndex. 

Each delete command also supports undo, restoring the last deleted book into the system.

**Key Methods**
1. `deleteBook(int bookIndex)` in `Library`

   _Deletes a book based on its index in the global catalog list._
   - Input by user: `delete num / 0`
   - Retrieves the book ID using the bookIndex
   - Delete book from global catalog using bookIndex
   - Removes book from its corresponding shelf using the book ID (replaces with a dummy book).
   - Returns a String to indicate book deletion.

2. `deleteBook(String bookTitle, String author)` in `Library`

   _Deletes a book based on its title and author in the global catalog list._
   - Input by user: `delete bk / The Hobbit / J.R.R. Tolkien`
   - Retrieves bookIndex and bookID using title and author
   - Delete book from global catalog using bookIndex
   - Removes book from its corresponding shelf using book ID(replaces with a dummy book).
   - Returns a String to indicate book deletion.

3. `deleteBook(String bookID)` in `Library`

   _Deletes a book based on its book ID._
   - Input by user: `delete id / AC-0-1`
   - Refer to [here](#bookid) for information about the formatting of book ID.
   - Retrieves bookIndex using book ID
   - Delete book from global catalog using bookIndex
   - Removes book from its corresponding shelf using book ID(replaces with a dummy book).
   - Returns a String to indicate book deletion.


**Execution Flow**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Assuming the initial state of the library is that there's one book titled `Book1` by `AuthorA`.

Step 1. The user types in the string input `delete num / 1` 
to delete the 1st book in the catalogue (in this case, it's `Book1`).

Step 2. The `Parser` class parses the input and creates a 
`DeleteByIndexCommand`.

Step 3. The `execute` method in this command class calls library's `deleteBook(Int bookIndex)` method.

Step 4. library calls upon `catalogueManager` `deleteBook(bookIndex)` to delete the book from the 
catalogue. The response containing information about the bookDeletion is stored in `response`.

Step 5. library calls retrieves the `bookID` using the `bookIndex` and passes it to `shelvesManager`
which deletes the book from the relevant shelf.

Step 6. Book deletion is complete. 
The response is finally returned back to `DeleteByIndexCommand` which calls `Ui` to print out the response.
`Storage` is also updated.

**Sequence Diagram** (of this example)
![](images/DeleteByIndexSequence.png)


### List Book Feature
The list book feature allows librarians to see the basic information of the 
catalogue in their system. This includes the `BookTitle`, `Author`, `BookID`
and the `DueDate` if the book was borrowed.

**Key Methods**

1. `listBooks()` in `BookManager`
   - List all books in the global catalogue with their respective information including their status, title, author, bookID and due date.
   - Input by user: `list`


**Execution Flow**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at each step:

Assuming the initial state of the library is that there's one book titled Book1 by AuthorA.

Step 1. The user types in the string input `list` to list all books in the catalogue.

Step 2. The `Parser` class parses the input and creates a ListCommand.

Step 3. The execute method in this command class calls library's `listBooks()` method.

Step 4. library calls upon catalogueManager's `listBooks()` method, stores the response.

Step 5. The response is returned to the command class and printed out by `Ui`.


### List Members with Overdue Books Feature
The list members with overdue books feature allows librarians to view a list of members who currently have overdue books.
It retrieves data from the `MemberManager` class, which maintains a list of all members and their borrowed books, and 
checks the overdue status of each book.

The feature is facilitated by the following components:
- `ListOverdueUsersCommand`: A command object that encapsulates the logic for listing members with overdue books.
- `MemberManager`: Responsible for managing all members and their borrowed books.
- `Member`: Represents an individual member and provides methods to retrieve their overdue books.
- `Ui`: Displays the formatted list of members with overdue books to the librarian.

**Key Methods**
- `listMembersWithOverdueBooks()` in `MemberManager` class:
  - Iterates through all members.
  - Checks each member's borrowed books for overdue status.
  - Returns a formatted string listing members with overdue books.
- `getOverdueBooks()` in `Member` class:
  - Returns a list of overdue books for a specific member.

**Execution Flow**
1. The librarian enters a string input `list overdue users`.
2. The `Parser` class parses the input and creates a `ListOverdueUsersCommand`.
3. The `execute` method in `ListOverdueUsersCommand` class calls MemberManager's `listMembersWithOverdueBooks()` method.
4. The `MemberManager` iterates through its list of members, checks for overdue books, and builds a formatted string containing the results.
5. The result is passed to the `Ui`, which displays it to the user.

**Sequence Diagram**

![ListUsersSequence](images/ListUsersSequence.png)


### Searching Feature
The search functionality is encapsulated within the BookFinder utility class and initiated by specific SearchBy...Command objects (`SearchByTitleCommand`, `SearchByAuthorCommand`, `SearchByGenreCommand`, `SearchByIDCommand`).
Delegation: Search logic is intentionally separated from `BookManager` into `BookFinder`. This promotes Separation of Concerns, making `BookManager` focused on catalogue management and `BookFinder` specialized in searching.

#### Commands & Behavior
1. SearchByTitleCommand
- Searches for books where the title contains the specified query (case-insensitive).  
**Input**: `find title <title_query>` (e.g., `find title Lord of the Rings`)
- Retrieves book list from `BookManager` via `Library`
- Uses `BookFinder.findBooksByTitle(titleQuery)`
- Displays matching books via `Ui`

2. SearchByAuthorCommand
- Searches for books where the author's name contains the specified query (case-insensitive).  
**Input**: `find author <author_query>` (e.g., `find author Tolkien`)
- Retrieves book list from `BookManager` via `Library`
- Uses `BookFinder.findBooksByAuthor(authorQuery)`
- Displays matching books via `Ui`

3. SearchByGenreCommand
- Searches for books matching the specified genre exactly (case-insensitive).  
**Input**: `find genre <genre_query>` (e.g., `find genre adventure`)
- Retrieves book list from `BookManager` via `Library`
- Uses `BookFinder.findBooksByGenre(genreQuery)`
- Displays matching books via `Ui`

4. SearchByIDCommand
- Searches for a book using the unique Book ID (case-insensitive).  
**Input**: `find id <book_id>` (e.g., `find id AD-0-0`)
- Retrieves book list from `BookManager` via `Library`
- Uses `BookFinder.findBooksByShelfId(bookId)`
- Displays result via `Ui`


#### Workflow:
1. The user enters a find command (e.g., `find title Lord of the Rings` or `find id AD-0-0`).
2. The `Parser` interprets this and creates the appropriate SearchBy...Command object (e.g., `SearchByTitleCommand` with the search term).
3. During execution (execute method), the SearchCommand:
4. Retrieves the `BookManager` instance via the `Library`.
5. Gets the current `List<Book>` from `BookManager`.
6. Creates a new `BookFinder` instance, passing the `bookList` to its constructor.
7. Calls the relevant search method on the `BookFinder` instance (e.g., `finder.findBooksByTitle(searchTerm)` or `finder.findBooksByShelfId(searchTerm)`).
8. BookFinder iterates through the provided bookList (using Java Streams and filtering) to find matching books. Searches are generally case-insensitive for user-friendliness.
9. The SearchCommand receives the list of results from `BookFinder`.
10. It then uses the `Ui` component to display the findings or a "not found" message to the user.

BookFinder provides specific methods for each search criterion (`findBooksByTitle`, `findBooksByAuthor`, `findBooksByGenre`, `findBooksByShelfId`). The user interacts with these via the find command using criteria: title, author, genre, or id.

Shown below is a simplified class diagram of Searching:
![Searching](images/Searching.png)


Simplified Sequence Diagram `SearchByTitleCommand`: This diagram illustrates the typical flow when a user performs a title search. (This remains unchanged as the core search flow is the same).
![SearchByTitleCommand](images/SearchByTitleCommand.png)

Design considerations:

Separate `BookFinder` class. (Current Choice)
1. Pros: Adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. `BookManager` stays focused on catalogue state, while `BookFinder` handles search algorithms. `BookFinder` can be tested independently. Easy to add new search types without modifying `BookManager`.

2. Cons: Requires passing the book list reference from `BookManager` to `BookFinder` upon creation. Introduces a small amount of indirection.

Implement search methods directly in `BookManager`
1. Pros: Reduces the number of classes. Search methods have direct access to the internal books list.

2. Cons: Bloats the `BookManager` class, mixing management and query responsibilities. Makes `BookManager` harder to test and potentially violates SRP.

Design considerations:


### Undo Feature
![UndoCommandClass](images/UndoCommandClass.png)

The Undo feature allows users to revert the effects of previous commands that modified the library's state (`add`, `delete`, `borrow`, `return`).
It retrieves the command history from the `UndoManager` class which maintains a stack of executed commands and calls `undo()` method of the most recent undoable command.

The feature is facilitated by the following components:
- `UndoCommand`: Command object encapsulating logic for performing undo operation.
- `UndoManager`: Responsible for storing and managing history of executed commands.
- `Command`: Abstract class that defines `undo()` method of all commands.
- `Ui`: Displays `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` messages after an undo operation is made.

**Key Methods**
- `undoCommands()` in `UndoManager`:
   - Pops and undoes the specified number of undoable commands from the history stack.
   - Displays error message in the event there are no undoable commands.
- `undo()` in `Command`:
   - Reverts changes made by command.
   - Implemented by undoable commands, empty for non-undoable commands.
- `confirmUndo()` in `Ui`:
    - Prompts user for confirmation before undoing. Accepts only `y`, `Y`, `n`, `N` as inputs.
- `execute()` in `Command`:
    - Returns `boolean` to indicate whether a command has been executed successfully.
    - Only successful commands are pushed onto the undo stack.

**Execution Flow**
1. User inputs string input `undo`.
2. `Parser` class parses input and creates UndoCommand instance.
3. Execute method in UndoCommand calls `Library`'s `getUndoManager()` method.
4. `UndoManager` invokes `undoCommands()` and checks command history.
5. `undo()` method called for each undoable command to revert operation.
6. `Ui` displays success message if command was undone successfully or error message if no commands to undo.

**Sequence Diagram**

![Undo Command Sequence Diagram](images/UndoCommandSequence.png)


### Statistics Feature
The Statistics feature allows librarians to get a quick overview of the library’s current status.

Statistics includes:
- Total number of books copies
- Total number of unique titles
- Total number of borrowed books
- Total number of books overdue
- List of unique book titles

The feature is facilitated by the following components:
- `StatisticsCommand`: Command object encapsulating the logic for computing and displaying statistics.
- `BookManager`: Provides access to the full list of books and contains helper methods to compute statistics.
- `Ui`: Displays formatted statistics in a user-friendly format.

**Key Methods**
- `getStatistics()` in `BookManager` class:
    - Calculates total book copies, number of unique titles and number of borrowed and overdue books.
    - Returns a formatted string with all statistics included.
- `getUniqueTitleSize()` and `getUniqueTitles()` in `BookManager` class:
    - Compute count and set of unique book titles.

**Execution Flow**
1. User inputs the command `statistics`.
2. Parser parses the input and creates a StatisticsCommand instance.
3. `execute()` in StatisticsCommand calls `library.getBookManager().getStatistics()`.
4. BookManager computes and returns the formatted statistics string.
5. Ui prints the statistics for the user to view.

## Handling missing/corrupted data files

To simulate a missing or corrupted data file:
1. Delete or rename the data file used by LeBook.
2. Run LeBook and attempt to perform operations.

## BookID
A variable tied to a `Book` and is unique to every new `Book` added.

**Format**

```
[GENRE_CODE]-[SHELF_INDEX]-[SLOT_NUM] 
Example: R-0-1
- R refers to 'Romance'
- '0' refers to Shelf 0
- '1' refers to Book 2
```

Expected behavior:
- LeBook should handle the absence or corruption of the data file gracefully.
- It should either create a new data file or display an error message indicating the problem.
