2. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - A build automation tool

## Design

### Parser component
**API:** [`Parser.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/parser/Parser.java)

Shown below is a simplified class diagram of the `Parser` component:
![ParserClass](images/ParserClass.png)

The parser component is responsible for interpreting user input and calling the appropriate command object.
It takes a string input from the user, determines the corresponding command type, and returns an instance of a subclass of Command.

How the parser component works:
1. Extracts the command keyword from the user input.
2. Matches the keyword to the relevant commands.
3. Parses and extracts the remaining arguments (if any).
4. Returns a corresponding Command object for execution.

### Storage Class
**API:** [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/storage/Storage.java)
1. **Overview**
   - The `Storage` class in LeBook is responsible for saving the data after the user exits `LeBook`. To load the data when the user launches `LeBook`, it reads data from a file and loads it into a list. When exiting the program, it writes the Books back into the file in a specific format.
2. **Design**
   - Each `Book` is stored in structured text using a `|` delimiter.
   - Each time the user exits the program, the file is overwritten, ensuring that the content is up to date.
   - If the file to save the data does not exist, an empty list is returned. Exceptions are caught and logged.
![StorageClass](images/StorageClass.png)


### Command Class

**Overview**
   - All commands extend the Command class, which is abstract and defines the execute() method.
   - The execute() method in each command class contains the logic to perform a specific action.
   - Each command interacts with Library (to manage catalogue and shelves), Ui (to print messages), and Storage (to save data to a file).

## Implementation

### Add Book Feature
*(to be updated)*

### Delete Book Feature
The delete book feature allows librarians to delete irrelevant books
from the library using their bookID, their unique title and author or
their bookIndex. 

Each delete command also supports undo, restoring the last deleted book into the system.

##### Commands & Behavior
1. DeleteByIndexCommand
   - Deletes a book based on its index in the global catalog list.
   - Input: delete num/0
   - Calls library.deleteBook(index)
   - Retrieves and stores the deleted book for undo
   - Removes it from its corresponding shelf (replaces with a dummy book)

2. DeleteByBookCommand
   - Deletes a book based on the title and author
   - Input: delete bk/The Hobbit/J.R.R. Tolkien
   - Retrieves the book from the library using matching title + author
   - Deletes and stores it for undo

3. DeleteByIDCommand
   - Deletes a book based on its unique book ID, e.g. AC-0-1.
   - Input: delete id/AC-0-1
   - Retrieves by ID â†’ deletes from catalog and updates shelf
   - Stored for undo

#### Execution Flow
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step

Assuming the initial state of the library is that there's one book titled `Book1` by `AuthorA`

Step 1. The user types in the string input `delete num/1` 
to delete the 1st book in the catalogue (in this case, it's `Book1`)

Step 2. The Parser class parses the input and creates a 
`DeleteByIndexCommand`.

Step 3. The `execute` method in this command class calls library's `deleteBook(Int bookIndex)` method

Step 4. library calls upon `catalogueManager` `deleteBook(bookIndex)` to delete the book from the 
catalogue. The response containing information about the bookDeletion is stored in `response`

Step 5. library calls retrieves the `bookID` using the `bookIndex` and passes it to `shelvesManager`
which deletes the book from the relevant shelf.

Step 6. Book deletion is complete. 
The response is finally returned back to Parser which prints out the `response`.
`Storage` is also updated.

**Sequence Diagram** (of this example)

### List Book Feature
The list book feature allows librarians to see the basic information of the 
catalogue in their system. This includes the `BookTitle`, `Author`, `BookID`
and the `DueDate` if the book was borrowed.

#### Commands & Behavior

1. ListCommand
   - List all books in the global catalogue with their respective information
   - Input: `list`
   - Calls library.listBooks() which returns the list of books in String format
   - UI prints the response
   
#### Execution Flow
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at each step

Assuming the initial state of the library is that there's one book titled Book1 by AuthorA

Step 1. The user types in the string input `list` to list all books in the catalogue

Step 2. The Parser class parses the input and creates a ListCommand.

Step 3. The execute method in this command class calls library's `listBooks()` method

Step 4. library calls upon catalogueManager's `listBooks()` method, stores the response

Step 5. The response is returned to the command class and printed out


### List Members with Overdue Books Feature
The list members with overdue books feature allows librarians to view a list of members who currently have overdue books.
It retrieves data from the `MemberManager` class, which maintains a list of all members and their borrowed books, and 
checks the overdue status of each book.

The feature is facilitated by the following components:
- `ListOverdueUsersCommand`: A command object that encapsulates the logic for listing members with overdue books.
- `MemberManager`: Responsible for managing all members and their borrowed books.
- `Member`: Represents an individual member and provides methods to retrieve their overdue books.
- `Ui`: Displays the formatted list of members with overdue books to the librarian.

**Key Methods**
- `listMembersWithOverdueBooks()` in `MemberManager` class:
  - Iterates through all members.
  - Checks each member's borrowed books for overdue status.
  - Returns a formatted string listing members with overdue books.
- `getOverdueBooks()` in `Member` class:
  - Returns a list of overdue books for a specific member.

**Execution Flow**
1. The librarian enters a string input `list users`.
2. The `Parser` class parses the input and creates a `ListOverdueUsersCommand`.
3. The `execute` method in `ListOverdueUsersCommand` class calls MemberManager's `listMembersWithOverdueBooks()` method.
4. The `MemberManager` iterates through its list of members, checks for overdue books, and builds a formatted string containing the results.
5. The result is passed to the `Ui`, which displays it to the user.

**Sequence Diagram**

### Catalogue Management (BookManager)
The `BookManager` class acts as the central repository for the logical catalogue of books. 
It is implemented as a Singleton to ensure a single source of truth for the book data throughout the application's lifecycle.

Internally, `BookManager` maintains a `private static List<Book> books`. 
This list holds all individual copies of books present in the library, including duplicates if multiple copies of the same title/author exist.
It handles core operations like adding new book entries (`addNewBookToCatalogue`), deleting books by index (`deleteBook(int)`), listing all entries (`listBooks`), updating borrowing status (`updateBookStatus`), and providing library statistics (`getStatistics`).

When adding a book, `BookManager` receives a `bookID` (generated by the `ShelvesManager`) which links the logical entry to its physical shelf location.
Methods like `getUniqueTitleSize()` and `getUniqueTitles()` utilize HashSet internally to efficiently derive statistics about unique titles from the main list containing all copies.

### Searching Logic (BookFinder and Search...Command)
The search functionality is encapsulated within the BookFinder utility class and initiated by specific SearchBy...Command objects (`SearchByTitleCommand`, `SearchByAuthorCommand`, `SearchByGenreCommand`, `SearchByIDCommand`).
Delegation: Search logic is intentionally separated from `BookManager` into `BookFinder`. This promotes Separation of Concerns, making `BookManager` focused on catalogue management and `BookFinder` specialized in searching.

Workflow:
1. The user enters a find command (e.g., find title Lord of the Rings or find id AD-0-0).
2. The Parser interprets this and creates the appropriate SearchBy...Command object (e.g., `SearchByTitleCommand` with the search term).
3. During execution (execute method), the SearchCommand:
4. Retrieves the `BookManager` instance via the `Library`.
5. Gets the current `List<Book>` from `BookManager`.
6. Creates a new `BookFinder` instance, passing the `bookList` to its constructor.
7. Calls the relevant search method on the `BookFinder` instance (e.g., `finder.findBooksByTitle(searchTerm)` or `finder.findBooksByShelfId(searchTerm)`).
8. BookFinder iterates through the provided bookList (using Java Streams and filtering) to find matching books. Searches are generally case-insensitive for user-friendliness.
9. The SearchCommand receives the list of results from `BookFinder`.
10. It then uses the Ui component to display the findings or a "not found" message to the user.

BookFinder provides specific methods for each search criterion (`findBooksByTitle`, `findBooksByAuthor`, `findBooksByGenre`, `findBooksByShelfId`). The user interacts with these via the find command using criteria: title, author, genre, or id.

Shown below is a simplified class diagram of the Catalogue Management component:
![CatalogueManager](images/CatalogueManager.png)


Simplified Sequence Diagram `SearchByTitleCommand`: This diagram illustrates the typical flow when a user performs a title search. (This remains unchanged as the core search flow is the same).
![SearchByTitleCommand](images/SearchByTitleCommand.png)

Design considerations:

Separate `BookFinder` class. (Current Choice)
1. Pros: Adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. `BookManager` stays focused on catalogue state, while `BookFinder` handles search algorithms. `BookFinder` can be tested independently. Easy to add new search types without modifying `BookManager`.

2. Cons: Requires passing the book list reference from `BookManager` to `BookFinder` upon creation. Introduces a small amount of indirection.

Implement search methods directly in `BookManager`
1. Pros: Reduces the number of classes. Search methods have direct access to the internal books list.

2. Cons: Bloats the `BookManager` class, mixing management and query responsibilities. Makes `BookManager` harder to test and potentially violates SRP.


### Undo Feature
The Undo feature allows users to revert the effects of previous commands that modified the library's state (`add`, `delete`, `borrow`, `return`).
It retrieves the command history from the `UndoManager` class which maintains a stack of executed commands and calls `undo()` method of the most recent undoable command.

The feature is facilitated by the following components:
- UndoCommand: Command object encapsulating logic for performing undo operation.
- UndoManager: Responsible for storing and managing history of executed commands.
- Command: Abstract class that defines `undo()` method of all commands.
- Ui: Displays `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` messages after an undo operation is made.

**Key Methods**
- `undoCommands()` in UndoManager class:
   - Pops and undoes the specified number of undoable commands from the history stack.
   - Displays error message in the event there are no undoable commands.
- `undo()` in Command class:
   - Reverts changes made by command.
   - Implemented by undoable commands, empty for non-undoable commands.

**Execution Flow**
1. User inputs string input `undo`.
2. Parser class parses input and creates UndoCommand instance.
3. Execute method in UndoCommand calls `Library`'s `getUndoManager() method.
4. UndoManager invokes `undoCommands()` and checks command history.
5. `undo()` method called for each undoable command to revert operation.
6. Ui displays success message if command was undone successfully or error message if no commands to undo.

### User Interface Class

1. Introduction
   The `Ui` class in LeBook handles all interactions with the user. It is responsible for reading inputs and printing outputs including welcome messages, command results and error messages.
   This class abstracts all system input/output logic to maintain separation of concerns in application.

2. Design and Implementation
   `Ui` class encapsulates a `Scanner` object to read inputs from `System.in`
   The `readCommand()` method prompts users for inputs and returns trimmed string for parsing.
   All output messages are standardized using `printWithSeparator(String message)`, which adds visual separators `=====` above and below messages for better readability.

3. Future enhancements
   Potentially add support for multi-lined inputs

### Handling missing/corrupted data files

To simulate a missing or corrupted data file:
1. Delete or rename the data file used by LeBook.
2. Run LeBook and attempt to perform operations.

Expected behavior:
- LeBook should handle the absence or corruption of the data file gracefully.
- It should either create a new data file or display an error message indicating the problem.

### Additional test cases

- **Invalid commands**: Test various invalid commands (e.g., `borrow`, `return`, `delete` without specifying a book number) to ensure that the application responds correctly with error messages.
- **Edge cases**: Test edge cases such as deleting books when the library is empty, borrowing or returning books that are not available or already borrowed, etc.
