## Overview

LeBook is a CLI-based library book management system that allows users to
add, borrow, return, and track books efficiently.

## Summary of Contributions

### Features Implemented:

- **Parse user input appropriately**
  - What it does: 
    - Processes user input, extracts relevant information, and calls the corresponding command. This allows users to conveniently enter a single string.
  - Justification:
    - This feature significantly improves usability. It ensures that user inputs are interpreted correctly, reducing errors and making the system more responsive.
  - Highlights:
    - The implementation required designing a structured way to process various types of input. It was also necessary to handle edge cases such as invalid input formats and missing parameters.
- **Listing of borrowed books**
  - What it does:
    - Allows users to view a list of all books currently borrowed by members, making it easier to track borrowed items.
  - Justification:
    - This feature improves book management by providing a quick and structured overview of borrowed books. It allows librarians to monitor the book statuses.
  - Highlights:
    - The implementation required iterating through the list of members and their borrowed books. Efficient data retrieval and formatting were key considerations to ensure that the listing remains clear and concise.
- **Listing of users with overdue books**
  - What it does:
    - Lists members who have overdue books along with the details of the overdue items. This feature is implemented with the Member and MemberManager classes.
  - Justification:
    - This feature enhances the book management system by making it easier to track overdue books and follow up with users who need to return them.
  - Highlights:
    - The implementation required the creation of a Member class, as well as a MemberManager class to handle all the library members. This feature involved checking each memberâ€™s borrowed books for overdue status and formatting the output for readability.
