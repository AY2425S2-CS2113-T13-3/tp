# LeBook User Guide

## Introduction

LeBook is a straightforward book management application that runs on the command line. With its clean interface and
simple commands, LeBook helps librarians keep track of their catalogue of books as well as the shelves they are on. Some
functionalities include adding a new book or borrowing a book.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Java 17 or later** installed.
2. Download the latest **LeBook.jar** from the releases page.
3. Place the `.jar` file in an empty folder (it will create a `data` subfolder for storage).
4. Run the application using:
   ```sh
   java -jar LeBook.jar
   ```

## Features

Note: Before continuing, you can refer to the format of book to understand what it is
displaying [(Book Format)](#book-status-and-format).

### 1. Adding a Book

**Format:**

```

**Example Output:**

3. **Delete by the book's bookID**

**Format 1 (By Index):**

_Simply use the command `list` to see the `BOOK_NUMBER` of the book that you want to delete_

```

```

**Format 2 (By Title/Author):**

```
delete bk/TITLE/AUTHOR

**Format:**

```

**Example:**

```

```

**Confirmation Prompt**
Before undoing, the system prompts: `Confirm undo 1 request? <y/n>:`
Only `y`, `Y`, `n`, `N` responses are accepted.
Invalid responses will show: `[ERROR] Please respond with 'y' or 'n'.`

**Error Cases**
- Input < 1: `[ERROR] Invalid undo count. Must be at least 1.`
- Input > 2147483647: `[ERROR] Undo count is too large. Maximum allowed is: 2147483647.`
- Input > number of undoable commands: `[ERROR] You only have 0 undoable command(s).`
